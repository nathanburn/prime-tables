# Prime Tables

## How to run the Prime Tables app?

### Running the app during development

- Run `npm start`
- Navigate your browser to `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html` to see the app running in your browser.

### Running the unit tests

- Start Karma with `npm test`
  - A browser will start and connect to the Karma server. Chrome is the default browser, others can
  be captured by loading the same url as the one in Chrome or by changing the `test/karma.conf.js`
  file.
- Karma will sit and watch your application and test JavaScript files. To run or re-run tests just
  change any of your these files.
